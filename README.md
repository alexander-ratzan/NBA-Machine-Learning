# üèÄ NBA Machine Learning üèÄ

The goal of this notebook is to find a model to best predict the All-NBA team for the 2019-2020 season, which was suspended due to coronavirus. Several models were trained, tested, and analyzed to find the best fit. See the 2019 notebooks for neural net and random forest prediction analytics and the 2020 notebooks for the 2019-2020 All-NBA team predictions.
